## Steps to follow
1. First go to [fetch_modules.py](/fetch_modules.py) and replace code with the code generated by you in [zoho developer console](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole)
2. Only run the [fetch_modules.py](/fetch_modules.py) file
3. An intermediate file "temp.text" is created.
4. Do not remove the intermediate file once it is created
5. If you have removed the intermediate file by mistake got to get_refresh_token.py and update 'code' with the newly generated code on [zoho developer console](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole)
